# MovieSeer

MovieSeer was my submission for [HackPrinceton](https://hackprinceton.com/) 2012.
It was a website that would recommend movies for you to watch. The
recommendations were generated using your ratings for movies you've already
seen. It used the [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) API to get
movie metadata and would try to find movies that are similar to ones you like.
So it was a very simplistic [content-based
filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system#Content-based_filtering)
approach.

It won the "Best Use of [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB)"
award. I still have the check that I got for it, though I believe Mongo got rid
of the monetary prize the next time they sponsored the hackathon, so they
probably figured it wasn't a great investment.

Fun fact: I'm pretty sure I started my GitHub account for this hackathon.
